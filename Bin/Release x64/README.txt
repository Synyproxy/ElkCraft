#  Dear User,                                                            #

#  Thanks for downloading ElkCraft! We were 4 programmers to work on     #
#  this project. It took us 5 weeks to get to this result. We do not     #
#  own the assets that we used in this project. Blocks, items, and       #
#  the idea comes from Mojang.                                           #

#  Now you know how to play this game! One more thing before I let you   #
#  begin your journey, you can tweak tons of parameters in ".ini" files  #
#  in the "Bin/Config/" folder.                                          #
#                                                                        #
#  You can choose which save to load by changing the ID in the file:     #
#  "Bin/Save/save.info" (Generated at first launch)                      #
#                                                                        #
